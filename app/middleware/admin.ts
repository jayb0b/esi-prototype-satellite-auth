/**
 * Route middleware: admin
 *
 * Restricts access to routes that declare `middleware: 'admin'` in their
 * definePageMeta. Users without the ROLE_ADMIN role in their Clerk
 * publicMetadata are turned away.
 *
 * Why import.meta.server guard:
 *   During SSR, Clerk validates the session token but does not fetch the full
 *   user profile, so publicMetadata is unavailable in a route middleware.
 *   The check runs on the client instead.
 *
 * Why the isLoaded await:
 *   On the client, Clerk loads asynchronously. Rather than allowing the
 *   navigation to proceed and adding per-page watchers, the middleware returns
 *   a Promise and the router holds the navigation until Clerk is ready.
 *
 * Redirect behaviour:
 *  - Not signed in  → /login (with a redirect param so they return after auth)
 *  - Signed in, no ROLE_ADMIN → / (silent redirect)
